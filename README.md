This repository provides a complete pipeline for computing the **swirl number** in OpenFOAM. The swirl number is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the degree of swirl motion in a flow. It is defined as the ratio of the axial flux of angular momentum to the axial flux of axial momentum, expressed as

$$ S = \frac{\displaystyle \int_A \rho u_\theta u_z r \mathrm{d}A}{R \displaystyle \int_A \rho u_z^2 \mathrm{d}A} $$ 

Where
* $\rho$ is the density
* $u_\theta$ is the tangential velocity
* $u_z$ is the axial velocity
* $r$ is the radial distance to the axis
* $R$ is a characteristic radius
* $A$ is the area of the cross-section



## Function Objects and Code Structure

The swirl number is computed using a functionObject (`funcObjSwirlNumber`) which consists of several other modular functionObjects:

| File                        | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `funcObjComponents`         | Extracts components of velocity vector                                                                   |
| `funcObjCylVel`             | Transforms Cartesian velocity field to cylindrical components                                            |
| `funcObjDerivedFields`      | Computes derived fields like $\rho \mathbf{U}$                                                           |
| `funcObjTangentialMomentum` | Computes local tangential momentum                                                                       |
| `funcObjlMomentumFlux`      | Computes the axial flux of tangential and axial momentum (numerator and denominator of the swirl number) |

Ideally, the swirl number can be computed using a unified functionObject, but this is the best that I could develop a short time. Maybe I develop a better version in the future, if I can find the time for it.


## Postprocessing

The arbitrary surface is sampled using a `plane` geometry and processed using `surfaceFieldValue`. The Python script `compute_swirl_number.py` loads the numerator and denominator files, computes the swirl number at each time step, and plots the swirl number over time (the figure above).
